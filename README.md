## Goal
**Satellite Society and Electricity Segmentation** targets semantic segmentation, seeking to adapt & use multiple models to achieve high accuracy classification. We will compare the performance of select models against a base UNet model. The model we want to compare UNet to is still in production. However, we expect it to be either UNet3+ or DeepLabV3.

## Instillation
 > TODO PR2

## Getting Started
> TODO PR2: check sample sent, include details on how to run Unet + how to adjust parameters

## Models 
### UNet
> TODO PR2: explain UNet, include architecture diagram, its stengths, and its weaksnesses.

### [ model for comparison TBD ]
> Here we will write an in depth description of why we chose our particular model, listing its strengths and how well it works with the dataset. If the model was take from somewhere, we would credit the original authors & also note any changes we made here. This model will likely be UNet3+ or DeepLabV3.

## Performance
### UNet
> TODO PR2: place training results as well as sample segmentation images. Write a brief descriptoin of results. Also include the training parameters + bands/satellites used.

| Epochs | F1 Score | Training Accuracy | Training Loss | Validation Accuracy | Validation Loss |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 10 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |
| 20 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |
| 30 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |


### [selected model: TBD]
> We can include & compare to as many models as need be. 
> Here we would do the same as we did above for UNet, but for the model we choose to select for training and comparision (which is tbd in PR3) 

| Epochs | F1 Score | Training Accuracy | Training Loss | Validation Accuracy | Validation Loss |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 10 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |
| 20 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |
| 30 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |
