The final project for UCI's CS 175: Project in Artificial Intelligence.

Developed by Brown Rice: [Levi Ramirez](https://github.com/Levi-Ramirez), [Shadi Bitaraf](https://github.com/ShadiBitaraf), [Vedaant Patel](https://github.com/Vedaantp), [Benjamin Wong](https://github.com/chiyeon)

## Goal
**[ Project Name ]** targets semantic segmentation, seeking to adapt & use [ model ] to achieve high accuracy classification. We will compare the performance of **[ model ]** against several other models including **(temporary: )** UNet with pretrained weights, UNet, Resnet, and Segmentation CNN.

## [ Model ]
> Here we would write an in depth description of why we chose our particular model, listing its strengths and how well it works with the dataset. If the model was take from somewhere, we would credit the original authors & also note any changes we made here.

## Performance
### [ model ]
> This is where we would put a brief description of the chosen model & how it works, as well as its overall performance. We could optionally also include the hyperparameters that lead us to these particular results.

| Epochs | F1 Score | Training Accuracy | Training Loss | Validation Accuracy | Validation Loss |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 10 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |
| 20 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |
| 30 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |

### UNet
> We can include & compare to as many models as need be. 

| Epochs | F1 Score | Training Accuracy | Training Loss | Validation Accuracy | Validation Loss |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 10 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |
| 20 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |
| 30 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |
